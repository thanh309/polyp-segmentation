## Checkpoints
This folder contains the pretrained weights for the ResNet50 model, which serves as the encoder for the main model. The primary model checkpoint should also be downloaded and placed in this directory for proper functionality.

Ensure that both the ResNet50 weights and the model checkpoint are correctly located here before running any code.
